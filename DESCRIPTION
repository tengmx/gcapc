Title: GC Aware Peak Caller
Version: 1.0.8
Author: Mingxiang Teng and Rafael A. Irizarry
Maintainer: Mingxiang Teng <tengmx@gmail.com>
Description: Peak calling for ChIP-seq data with
    consideration of potential GC bias in sequencing
    reads. GC bias is first estimated with generalized
    linear mixture models using effective GC strategy,
    then applied into peak significance estimation.
